# COMPREHENSIVE DATA CLEANING SUMMARY

## Project Overview
This project involved cleaning a corrupted fictional dataset related to historical events. The dataset contained various issues including missing values, corrupted text, inconsistent formats, special characters, typos, and values outside of reasonable ranges. Our goal was to apply a combination of techniques to create a cleaned, standardized dataset suitable for analysis.

## Data Issues Encountered

1. **Special Characters**: Event names and other text fields contained non-standard characters ($, @, #, !, etc.)
2. **Spelling Errors**: Event names and categories contained various spelling mistakes and typos
3. **Missing Values**: Significant number of empty cells across all columns
4. **Inconsistent Formatting**: Especially in country names and event references
5. **Duplicate Records**: Multiple entries for the same event IDs
6. **Unrealistic Values**: Years in the future, source confidence values outside the [0-1] range
7. **Data Type Issues**: Numeric fields containing text and vice versa

## Cleaning Approach

### 1. Text Cleaning and Normalization

#### Special Character Removal and Substitution
- Created a mapping of special characters to their likely intended letters (e.g., '$' → 's', '@' → 'a')
- Implemented a function to apply these replacements systematically
- Used regular expressions to remove any remaining non-alphanumeric characters

#### Enhanced Spell Correction
- Built a comprehensive dictionary of common correctly spelled words and their misspellings
- Created a substring matching algorithm to handle partial matches and patterns in misspellings
- Dynamically expanded our correction dictionary by analyzing the most common words in the dataset
- Applied techniques including:
  * Exact word matching for direct corrections
  * Substring matching for partial word recognition
  * Edit distance calculations to find closest valid words
  * Handling of missing letters and common error patterns

#### Automated Spelling Correction System
- Implemented a self-improving spelling correction system that:
  * Stores corrections in a persistent JSON file (`spelling_corrections.json`)
  * Currently maintains 310 word correction pairs
  * Automatically loads existing corrections for each run
  * Detects new misspellings using NLP techniques and frequency analysis
  * Adds new corrections to the dictionary during processing
  * Saves all corrections back to the JSON file for future use
- This system ensures continuous improvement of the correction capability with minimal manual intervention
- The correction dictionary grows more comprehensive with each processing run

### 2. Machine Learning Approaches

#### Edit Distance-Based Text Correction
- Implemented Levenshtein distance calculations to quantify similarity between words
- Used normalized edit distance to account for word length differences
- Applied threshold-based correction to avoid overcorrection of valid unique terms

#### Pattern Recognition in Event Names
- Extracted and analyzed the structure of event names (typically "Descriptor + Type")
- Identified the most common event types (Breakthrough, Crisis, Reform, Revolution, etc.)
- Used these patterns to standardize inconsistent event names
- Applied similarity scoring to match corrupted event types to standard ones

#### Clustering for Text Standardization
- Built a system to automatically identify common prefixes and suffixes in event names
- Created reference sets of correctly spelled event name components
- Generated a comprehensive set of valid complete event names for reference
- Used these references to standardize inconsistent or corrupted names

### 3. Statistical Approaches

#### Imputation for Missing Values
- Implemented category-based median imputation for missing years
- Applied event type-based value inference for missing categories
- Used KNN-inspired approaches to fill gaps based on similar records
- Employed weighted random sampling based on observed distributions for remaining values

#### Outlier Detection and Handling
- Identified and capped unrealistic year values (setting max_allowed_year = 2024)
- Adjusted values in the Source Confidence column to fit the [0-1] range
- Transformed percentage-like values (e.g., 80) to proper decimals (0.80)
- Fixed negative values where inappropriate

### 4. Data Validation and Standardization

#### Country Standardization
- Created a validation system for country values
- Standardized to accepted formats (Country A through Country E)
- Identified and handled invalid or corrupt country references

#### Category Standardization
- Established a set of valid categories (Science, Culture, Politics, War, Technology, Economy)
- Created a mapping system to standardize category names
- Implemented pattern matching to correct misspelled categories
- Used event keyword analysis to infer missing categories from event descriptions

#### Year Correction
- Updated the year validation to accept values between 1600-2024
- Special handling for preserving valid years in the 2020-2024 range
- Implemented logic to adjust distant past years into reasonable ranges

### 5. Duplicate and Structural Issues

#### Duplicate Handling
- Identified duplicate event entries based on Event ID
- Applied intelligent selection criteria to keep the most complete entries
- Used source confidence as a secondary sorting criterion

#### Data Restructuring
- Rearranged columns in a logical order
- Applied forward-fill for missing event IDs to maintain data integrity
- Ensured consistent data types for each column

### 6. Automated Analysis and Verification

- Generated comprehensive summary statistics before and after cleaning
- Created distribution analysis for event types, categories, countries, and year ranges
- Calculated data completeness metrics for all columns
- Performed validation checks on the final dataset

## Results

The cleaning process successfully transformed the corrupted dataset:
- Original dataset: 606 rows with numerous issues
- Cleaned dataset: 500 unique events with complete information
- Achieved 100% data completeness (no missing values)
- Standardized all text fields
- Corrected and normalized all numeric values
- Identified and standardized 6 main event types
- Applied year corrections to properly handle dates up to 2024

## Technical Implementation

- Used Python with pandas for data manipulation
- Employed NLTK for natural language processing tasks including tokenization and edit distance calculations
- Utilized scikit-learn for machine learning components
- Implemented custom functions for specialized cleaning tasks
- Applied regular expressions for pattern matching
- Created a multi-stage pipeline approach to data cleaning
- Built a persistent, self-improving spelling correction system using JSON for storage
