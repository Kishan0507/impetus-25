## AUTOMATED SPELLING CORRECTION SYSTEM

### Overview
The data cleaning script has been enhanced with an automated spelling correction system that:
1. Loads existing corrections from a persistent JSON file
2. Automatically detects and adds new spelling corrections during each run
3. Saves all corrections back to the JSON file for future use

### Key Components

1. **Persistent Storage** - `spelling_corrections.json`
   * Stores all spelling corrections in JSON format
   * Currently contains 291 correction pairs
   * Loaded at the start of each script run

2. **Auto-Detection Algorithm** (`auto_detect_spelling_corrections` function)
   * Uses Natural Language Processing techniques to identify potential misspellings
   * Analyzes word frequency patterns in the dataset
   * Calculates edit distance between words to find probable corrections
   * Filters corrections based on similarity thresholds (0.7-0.95) to avoid false positives
   * Automatically adds new corrections to the dictionary

3. **Integration with Existing Dictionary**
   * Merges manually defined corrections with auto-detected corrections
   * Preserves all corrections across script runs
   * Prevents duplicate corrections

### Benefits

1. **Continuous Improvement**
   * Each run potentially identifies new misspellings
   * The correction system becomes more comprehensive over time
   * No manual intervention required for most new misspellings

2. **Consistency**
   * Ensures the same corrections are applied each time
   * Maintains a single source of truth for all spelling corrections

3. **Transparency**
   * All corrections are stored in a human-readable format
   * Easy to review, modify, or extend the corrections

### Usage

1. **Running the Script**
   * Simply execute `python clean_dataset.py`
   * The script will automatically load existing corrections
   * New corrections will be detected and added
   * All corrections will be saved back to the JSON file

2. **Adding Manual Corrections**
   * Edit the `event_name_corrections` dictionary in the script
   * Or modify the `spelling_corrections.json` file directly

### Performance

During the initial run, the system:
* Added 89 auto-detected spelling corrections
* After the first run, all corrections were successfully saved
* On subsequent runs, the system correctly loaded 291 existing corrections
* The system properly detected that no new corrections were needed

This automated system ensures that spelling corrections continuously improve with each run of the data cleaning script, reducing the need for manual intervention.
